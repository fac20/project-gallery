# FAC20 Projects Gallery

A site for showcasing the wonderful projects created by FAC20, the 20th Cohort of Founders and Coders.

In weeks 1-9 we build projects in teams of 4 in a day and a half, followed by code review and presentations to the rest of the cohort about our approach, challenges encountered and what we learnt! The second half of the course is dedicated to two longer projects - each of which consists of a design sprint and two build sprints.

Credit to Jan @[crianonim](https://github.com/crianonim) for the fantastic idea!

## Updating and maintaining this repo

This repo is a space for FAC20 to host the projects each team creates each week. It is up to you how you'd like to keep this site maintained and how you'd like to lay it out and design it!

For reference, see: [FAC-17 projects gallery](https://github.com/fac-17/fac17-projects-gallery) & [FAC-18 projects gallery](https://github.com/fac18/fac18-projects-gallery). A full list of FAC-19's projects can be seen as issues [here](https://github.com/fac19/projects-gallery/issues) and as a more complex accumulation of what they'd learned on the course [here](https://fac19.herokuapp.com/).
